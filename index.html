     <b>What is HTML and its Purpose</b>
     </div>
     <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
          <b>HTML</b> is an acronym for <em> Hypertext Markup Language</em>. Programmer's write code as HTML documents.  Basically code tells the web page what it is going to look like.
        <p> Computers have no idea what you want them to do unless you write programming code that tells it exactly what you want the web page to look like in the end result. The next, two sections will give a basic understanding of HTML vocabulary.</p>

        <b>Tags and Elements</b>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
       <p>
        The HTML Markup consists of tags and elements.  Tags are contained within angled brackets.  On the keyboard they are the <em> less than </em> and the <em> greater than </em>  symbols. During the first lesson, the instructor used <a href="https://www.udacity.com/html_playground"> the Udacity playground </a> for illustration.
      </p>
      <p>The opening tag, the contents within and the closing tag comprise the code <em> element</em>.

        <b>Attributes and the HREF</b>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
        Attributes are values that provides additional information, or configure the behaviour of a HTML elements in a way, which is appropriate for the end users. Some example of attributes can be, class, id, href, src, rel, and media. Whenever you look at a web site and it has images those images are attributes.  The programming code for image is <em> img src</em>.
      </p>
      <p>Sometimes when you read an article on the web it contains hyperlinks with references to other online articles.  These attributes use a programming attribute name called <b>href</b>.

        <b>HTML Head and Body in Code Structure</b>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
           When writing HTML code the programmer has to choose a software to write the code.  <em> Scratchpad.io</em> is a basic HTML editor for beginners. In order to write the code the programmer has to give a title to the item and classify what it is.
      </p>
        <p>The <b> body</b> of HTML is content.  So the writing we read in paragraphs would be considered body in HTML. Content is the contents of the document.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="concept" id="lesson-2-2">
      <div class="concept-title">
        <b>HTML, CSS and Javascript</b>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
           There are three, major dimensions to creating a web page. The HTML document is the structure of the web page.  Without an HTML foundation there is no web page.
      </p>
        <p>
         This structure consists of boxes that the programmer has to visualize when creating a web page. By looking at sections of a web page the programmer has to count the boxes so s/he can classify these boxes in her coding.
      </p>
     <p>The next dimension of a web page is <em> Cascading Style Sheets,</em> also known as <b>CSS</b>. Web pages have color, backgrounds, borders, fonts...this is the style of the web page.  CSS is written in a separate column from HTML and it tells the computer what artistic features to put on the page.</p>
      <p>Another aspect of a web page is Javascript. Interactive components of a web page are a result of Javascript. Web developers usually assign the changing elements of a web page, the Javascript, to one programmer.  More in-depth coverage of Javascript will be in future segments.</p>

        <b>DOM Tree-Like Structure</b>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
       <p>
       According to Wikipedia, <b>DOM</b> "The Document Object Model (DOM) is a cross-platform and language-independent convention for representing and interacting with objects in HTML, XHTML, and XML documents.[1] The nodes of every document are organized in a tree structure, called the DOM tree. Objects in the DOM tree may be addressed and manipulated by using methods on the objects. The public interface of a DOM is specified in its application programming interface (API)."
      </p>
      <p>DOM is the elements of a tree.  HTML uses tags and these tags can be organized into a tree-like structure, which is DOM.  DOM is an absolute component in a programmer's organization of the HTML documents they create.</p>

        <b>CSS Inheritance</b>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>
        According to Wikipedia, "Inheritance is a key feature in CSS, it relies on the ancestor-descendant relationship to operate. Inheritance is the mechanismby which properties are applied not onlyto specified element, but also to its descendants. Inheritance relies on the document tree, which is the hierarchy of (X)HTML elements in a page based on nesting."
      </p>
      <p>Programmers use <a href= "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference" >this web site </a> as their CSS reference. </p>

      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
         <p>
      Within the HTML document, add a "head" tag at the top of your HTML.  Then add a "link" tag.  After "link" add the following: rel="stylesheet" type="css" and then href="main.css."

        <b>The Box Model</b>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description"> 
     <p>In the box model, the center is content.  Surrounding content is padding, which is surrounded by border and then the border is encapsulated by margin.  In CSS the programmer has to determine box width, height, margin, border-width, and border-color. Sizes can be determined in either percents or pixels.

      <div class="concept-title">
        <b>DRY: Do Not Repeat Yourself</b>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p> As criteria for passing this phase of the project, the instructors want explanations as to why there should not be repetition in coding.<p>
        <p> According to Wikipedia, DRY, or Do Not Repeat Yourself "In software engineering, donâ€™t repeat yourself (DRY) is a principle of software development, aimed at reducing repetition of information of all kinds, especially useful in multi-tier architectures. The DRY principle is stated as 'Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.' The principle has been formulated by Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas in their book The Pragmatic Programmer."</p>
        <p> Repetitive programming code leads to monotonous patterns. The programmer limits herself from using the tools she has available to her. The end result will be a limited web page. Therefore, if the programmer challenges her skillset, then the web page itself will illustrate the programmer's code skill level.
        <p>With regards to the benefits of not repeating code; repetitive code tends to become large. And if there is a problem in the first code and its template has been repeated numerous times, the errors will be repeated also.  If there is less code then there is less chance for problems. If the future brings changes to the code then the less code there is to update the better off is the programmer.

      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>A computer is a machine that can be told what to do.  Computers can do anything. Computers have programs that make them into servers, web browsers and mobile apps.  In order for the computer to do anything and/or any kind of computation it needs instructions.

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>A program is a set of instructions that tells the computer what to do. In the end result, whatever a computer is designed to do depends upon the development of the program.  The program is comprised of a sequence of steps.  However programming cannot be done in natural human language, it has to be done in programming language.</p>

        <b>Python Programming Language</b>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>One of the major programming languages used on computers is called Python.  Python is an interpreter of the programs humans want to run on computers.  The programmer writes Python code inside the program and then Python interprets that code to give the computer instructions. The Python interpreter follows the instruction the programmer gives it based on the code.  It can be run in the web browswer.  This is an example of procedural thinking.

        <p>According to Wikipedia, "In computer science, BNF (Backus Normal Form or Backusâ€“Naur Form) is one of the two[1] main notation techniques for context-free grammars, often used to describe the syntax of languages used in computing, such as computer programming languages, document formats, instruction sets and communication protocols."
        </p>
        <p>Basically Python grammar is more strict than natural language grammer.  Python grammar is ambiguity-free, which means it is not open for interpretation. The instructor used diagramming-sentence techniques to explain Python grammar.</p> 
        <p>Through this form the instructor took subjects, verbs and nouns and gave them assignments.  They he drew arrows to assign their replacements.  He broke down the non-terminals and gave them replacements.  Through the diagramming, or derivation as he called it, he dissected each item until it reached a terminal end.  This is how the Python interpreter understands a program because the instructions tell it what the terminals will be.</p>

        <p>According to Wikipedia, a variable in programming is "In computer programming, a variable or scalar is a storage location paired with an associated symbolic name (an identifier), which contains some known or unknown quantity or information referred to as a value. The variable name is the usual way to reference the stored value; this separation of name and content allows the name to be used independently of the exact information it represents. The identifier in computer source code can be bound to a value during run time, and the value of the variable may thus change during the course of program execution."

        <p>In the lesson Dave described the parts to put together an assigned statement.  To the left of the equal sign is a variable and then to the right of the equal sign is the assigned value.  Together they comprise the assigned statement.</p>
        <p> For example in the class Dave said:</p>
        <p><span class="code">speed_of_light = 299792458</span></p>

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p> The best way to describe Strings in Python is by how Python understands it.  After the variable is an equal sign.  After the equal sign is an assigned value that is a name, an expression, or a number.  Whatever the programmer input after the equal sign it has to be contained within either single quotation marks or double quotation marks.

   <h1>Lesson III: The Power of Abstraction</h1>
<div class="lesson">
    <h2>Important Concept: Object-Oriented Programming </h2>
    <div class="concept">
      <div class="concept-title">
        <b><span class="code">Object- Oriented Programming and Abstraction</span></b>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>According to Wikipedia, Object-Oriented Programming, also known as OOP "...is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects', which are data structures that contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods. A distinguishing feature of objects is that an object's procedures can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of 'this'). In object-oriented programming, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.[1][2] There is significant diversity in object-oriented programming, but most popular languages are class-based, meaning that objects are instances of classes, which typically also determines their type."
        </p>
        <p>In Python, programmers use <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/contents.html">the Python Standard Library</a> as the foundation for creating abstract templates. The Python Standard Library is an extensive list of modules with hyperlinks that explain all the functions and classes available in Python. Basically the Python Standard Library (PSL) is a library of endless objects and how they interact together to create a program. In some cases the library provides solutions to programming-problem scenarios.  Abstract thinking is an integral part of Object-Oriented Programming, OOP, because it can take a function that has a set of features. These attributes create more space for programming beyond what the programmer is typing.   In Python there is code and data that interact to create an object.  These objects are class instances that can have extensive attributes.  The objects interact with each other.</p>
        <p> 
        For example a function such as webbrowser.open is a simple function because it performs the activity in the typing of the function explicitly.  Then there are functions such as the module turtle that have Classes inside the function, such as Turtle.  The class Turtle has a subset of activities associated with it, which are listed in the Python Standard Library.  Suddenly the programmer has enhanced dimension of space and movement simply by utilizing the class.  A whole set of features are associated in the class Turtle. Hence, these attributes create the abstract space within OOP.</p>
        <p>Object-Oriented Programming has advantages.  Since it is based on modules, any time programming updates and changes need to be made it can be done at the modular level, not by changing the entire program with numerous corrections.  This saves time in the long-term. Examples of modules covered in the course are: Webbrowser, Time, OS, URLlib, and then the function URLopen inside URLLib. Second, OOP code is reusable, which means shorter, software development time and the code created already can be used for future projects. During the course we used the classes Turtle, as well as the init-like functions of open(file) and urllib.urlopen.  The last two were more inherent because the functions had to be called (returned) to show their class function. The classes with attributes means there is a library of extensive objects to choose from for a project.  And whatever is created can be used for future use.</p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="concept">
      <div class="concept-title">
        <b>Classes</b>
      </div>
      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>As mentioned, another interesting feature about Object-Oriented Programming, OOP is that it contains <b><span class="code"> classes. </span></b>  A class can have several functions contained within the class, along with data.  Then there is a dot to give the function an operation to perform in Python.  The class can have a set of activities inside its organized structure.  This space is the abstract part of OOP.  When a programmer uses a class, and initiates it, then it creates an <b>instance</b> inside Python, otherwise known as an object of that class.  
       </p>
        <p>
        For example in the class Professor Kunal utilized class.Turtle to create a yellow square called Brad and a blue circle called Angie. Brad and Angie were objects of the class.  Turtle, which is a class file contained within the module turtle, contained operations for color, shape, movement, and speed.  The end result of going to the module turtle, accessing the file Turtle within the folder, and tapping the initiate Python file within Turtle, were class instances; and in this example, the instance objects were called Brad and Angie.
        </p>
        <p>Instructor Kunal explained class is like a blueprint because it gives the details of the number and the size of the potential object to be created by the code. Class is like the folder within the the business plan for an organization. The class folder contains an outline of directives and each of the directives will have a subset of function-files, which need to be initiated in the space of the organization. Some of the function-files are self-explanatory; for example, the activity, stay within budget, because the function-files explains what should happen in the end result. However more detailed functions-files, increase productivity in IT-development by 25 % will have classes of activities to create the end result determined by the class itself.</p>
       <p>
       In programming, when the classes are initiated they are considered class instances or objects.  An example Instructor Kunal explained was <em> rest.TwilioRestClient():</em>.  Twilio was the folder downloaded to the laptop and insider was the rest folder.  Inside rest has a python file for the rest client. The parentheses indicate to tap the initiate function.  Both Turtle and Twilio are like wooden Babushka/Stacking/Nesting Dolls.  Start with the large directory doll to initiate the next class of doll inside and her set of features files; and then go to the next doll inside to see what her folder contains and initiate her classes. Each doll has classes and data, which expands to more abstract space and memory.

      <div class="concept-description">
        <p>Instructor Kunal continued with the concept of making classes through the building of a movies web site.  Earlier in the course we were introduced to the class Turtle and instances of those classes were Brad and Angie.  In the movies' website, adding movies to the website are instances of the class Movie. Through the exercise we continued building on what we learned in the previous exercises. 
        </p>
        <p>
        We created a python file called media and a separate file called entertainment center. Then he imported the media file into the entertainment center file. The class Movie had the <b> def_init_</b> function called within Python, which creates space and memory in Python. Init also is another instance inside the class movie.  Def_init is also called a <em>constructor,</em> after which he typed the word <b>self.</b> Then he typed the word self, which is a class name Python keyword.  The init_function took the variables title, storyline, poster image, and youtube trailer to remember inside the class Movie.  Self is an instance object.  All of the items associated with self instance/object are called instance variables because use of the function self creates the instance variables. When we use def show-trailer this is called a function or an instance method because we initialize the init function. When we use webbrowser.open the movie is the instance variable and using self within an instance is called an instance method.

        <p>Finally, Instructor Kunal explained more advanced concepts in OOP, such as inheritance.  When class Parent is created and it has a class Child, the class Child will inherit attributes within class Parent.  For example, the Instructor define an instance method called show_info inside class Parent.  And then instances within class Child can inherit the Parent's instance method even though show-info was not originally an attribute of class Child.  When the subset class uses attributes it inherited from the parent class; this is called Method Overriding.
